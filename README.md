# Containers with Docker
The objective of this project is to familiarise with container and docker terminology and the basics of docker command-line usage. Here we build our own docker images.

## Part A

### Preparation

1. Download and install docker on your computer following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Test your docker installation and get familiar with container terminology as explained [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)  

Note that on Linux you may need to prefix all the docker commands with ‘sudo’ if your account is not in the docker group.

You may optionally use the following resources to familiarise yourself with docker.

### Instructions
In the lab zip file you find four simple Node.js applications within the subdirectories. The Dockerfile under ‘app1/’ demonstrates how to build and run ‘app1.js’.  For some of the exercises you will need to create Dockerfiles for the rest of the applications.  
  
Do not modify the directory structure or any of the files given.
